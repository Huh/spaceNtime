# spaceNtime
Welcome! This package contains the code to create encounter histories for and run Time-to-Event, Space-to-Event, and Instantaneous Sampling analyses described in ["Three novel methods to estimate abundance of unmarked animals using remote cameras" by Moeller et al. (2018)](https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ecs2.2331).

This is my first package and is very much in development, so it is guaranteed to have bugs. If you're brave enough to use it, I would appreciate hearing from you if you encounter problems! Please check back frequently, because I will be actively adding new features. 

## Getting started 
Please try installing the package and viewing the vignette.

`devtools::install_github("annam21/spaceNtime", build_opts = c("--no-resave-data", "--no-manual"), force = T)`
