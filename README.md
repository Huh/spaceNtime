# TTE.STE.IS
Welcome! This package contains the code to create encounter histories for and run Time-to-Event, Space-to-Event, and Instantaneous Sampling analyses described in "Three novel methods to estimate abundance of unmarked animals using remote cameras" by Moeller et al. (2018).

This is my first package and is very much in development, so it is guaranteed to have bugs. If you're brave enough to use it, I would appreciate hearing from you if you encounter problems!

## Getting started 
Please try installing the package and viewing the vignette.

`devtools::install_github("annam21/TTE.STE.IS", build_opts = c("--no-resave-data", "--no-manual"), force = T)`

`browseVignettes("TTE.STE.IS")`

Then click on HTML.
